//
// Cargo <-> PlatformIO helper C file (autogenerated by cargo-pio)
// This file is intentionally empty. Please DO NOT change it or delete it!
//
// Two reasons why this file is necessary:
// - PlatformIO complains if the src directory is empty with an error message
//   'Nothing to build. Please put your source code files to '../src' folder'. So we have to provide at least one C/C++ source file
// - The Cargo invocation is attached as a post-action to building this file. This is necessary, or else
//   Cargo crates will not see the extra include directories of all libraries downloaded via the PlatformIO Library Manager
//
